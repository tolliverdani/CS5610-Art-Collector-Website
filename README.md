# Project Overview

For our final project, @nziegler87 and I worked together to create a website for art collectors to inventory, discover, and buy/sell/trade art. We deployed the full-stack JS application with React/Redux front end, Node.js server design, and a NoSQL database with MongoDB. Part of the project was developing our own API RESTful endpoints to manage user information as well as integrating third-party calls to WikiArt's API to supplement art data generated to website.
